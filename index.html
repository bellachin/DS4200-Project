                Presently, numerous people need cars to get around without an
                accessible transportation system nearby. Car pricing plays a
                vital role within the automotive industry and consumers
                worldwide. Numerous factors, including production costs, brand
                reputation, market demand, technological aspects, economic
                conditions, and profit margin, determine a car's price.
                Automakers must carefully balance affordability, profitability,
                and competitiveness when setting car prices. At the same time,
                consumers navigate pricing strategies such as discounts,
                financing options, and depreciation rates to make informed
                purchasing decisions. Car pricing is important because it
                affects accessibility and affordability to vehicles, influencing
                how individuals and families choose vehicles to meet their needs
                and budgets. Additionally, car pricing trends can provide
                insights into shifts in consumer preferences, innovation,
                environmental considerations, and global market fluctuations,
                which makes this dataset an intriguing subject for analysis and
                discussion.

              <p>
                We have selected an existing dataset from Kaggle that contains
                10,000 observations and 10 features, allowing us to explore
                patterns in pricing and market trends. The dataset includes both
                categorical features, like Brand, Model, Fuel Type, and
                Transmission, and numerical features, such as Year, Engine Size,
                Mileage, Doors, Owner Count, and Price. This variety helps us
                analyze car market price prediction. There are key numerical
                variables, such as Engine Size and Mileage, that can help
                estimate vehicle prices or cost. Additionally, some categorical
                features like Fuel Type and Transmission provide insights into
                customer preferences and market trends. While we lack some
                details, like regional pricing or maintenance history, the
                dataset still provides valuable insights into the automotive
                market.

                This reference shows factors that people usually do not realize
                are also related to the price of second-hand cars. The seven key
                factors influencing used car prices are as follows: 1. Age and
                Mileage of the Vehicle 2. Make and Model of the Vehicle 3.
                Condition of the Car 4. Market Demand and Economic Conditions 5.
                Vehicle History Report 6. Location and Geographic Factors 7.
                Technological Features and Upgrades. There are two things that I
                want to point out; the technological features here are not only
                about the entertainment features in the car but also about the
                car as a whole. As technology is more advanced day by day,
                electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids, these types of cars are
                holding their value better than traditional gasoline-powered
                cars. Other than that, economic conditions and trends are also a
                hidden factor. During a recession or economic downturn, people
                are less likely to buy new cars, which increases the demand for
                used cars. In the past few weeks, there has been a new tariff
                targeting imported materials and cars, which will significantly
                influence the car market in the future.

                This reference analyzes consumer attitudes toward electric
                vehicles (EVs) with a focus on pricing and policy implications.
                Using survey data from Manitoba, Canada, it applies both the van
                Westendorp price sensitivity method and willingness-to-pay
                analysis. Findings show that most consumers are reluctant to pay
                substantial premiums for EVs, even when aware of long-term fuel
                savings. However, consumers with direct EV experience
                demonstrate higher willingness to pay. The reference suggests
                that consumer education, rather than solely financial
                incentives, is crucial to enhancing EV adoption.
