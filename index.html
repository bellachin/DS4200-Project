              Presently, numerous people need cars to get around without an accessible transportation system nearby. 
              Car pricing plays a vital role within the automotive industry and consumers worldwide. 
              Numerous factors, including production costs, brand reputation, market demand, technological aspects, economic conditions, and profit margin, determine a car's price. 
              Automakers must carefully balance affordability, profitability, and competitiveness when setting car prices. 
              At the same time, consumers navigate pricing strategies such as discounts, financing options, and depreciation rates to make informed purchasing decisions. 
              Car pricing is important because it affects accessibility and affordability to vehicles, influencing how individuals and families choose vehicles to meet their needs and budgets. 
              Additionally, car pricing trends can provide insights into shifts in consumer preferences, innovation, environmental considerations, and global market fluctuations, which makes this dataset an intriguing subject for analysis and discussion.

              We are working with a dataset of 10,000 cars, allowing us to explore patterns in pricing and market trends. 
              The dataset includes both categorical features, like Brand, Model, Fuel Type, and Transmission, and numerical features, such as Year, Engine Size, Mileage, Doors, Owner Count, and Price. 
              This variety helps us analyze how different factors impact car prices and consumer choices. 
              While we lack some details, like regional pricing or maintenance history, the dataset still provides valuable insights into the automotive market through visualizations and analysis.

              This reference investigates how consumers' socio-demographic and economic characteristics influence their decision to purchase new or used cars across different car segments in the French market. 
              It finds that factors such as income, education, household size, and access to credit significantly affect whether consumers opt for new or used vehicles, and which segment (small, compact, intermediate, luxury) they choose. 
              The research provides valuable insights into consumer behavior in a mature European car market using multinomial logit modeling.

              This reference analyzes consumer attitudes toward electric vehicles (EVs) with a focus on pricing and policy implications. 
              Using survey data from Manitoba, Canada, it applies both the van Westendorp price sensitivity method and willingness-to-pay analysis. 
              Findings show that most consumers are reluctant to pay substantial premiums for EVs, even when aware of long-term fuel savings. 
              However, consumers with direct EV experience demonstrate higher willingness to pay. 
              The reference suggests that consumer education, rather than solely financial incentives, is crucial to enhancing EV adoption.
