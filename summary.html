                                This project revealed several key insights into car pricing:
                                <br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Correlation Analysis:</strong> Newer cars and larger engines tend to drive up prices, higher mileage is generally associated with lower prices.
                     The heatmap reveals that car price positively correlates with car year (0.66) and engine size (0.36), while it has a 
                    moderate negative correlation with mileage (-0.55). Other features such as door count and ownership history show almost no correlation with price, suggesting minimal impact.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Year vs. Price Trend:</strong> From the scatter plot, we observe a clear upward trend in prices as car models get newer. Despite some noise, 
                    the overall pattern supports the correlation with Year from the heatmap.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Brand & Model Popularity:</strong> The treemap shows that brands like Ford, Honda, Chevrolet, and Audi dominate the dataset in terms of model counts. 
                    Popular models include Fiesta, Accord, Impala, and A4, indicating strong market representation(eg. depreciate less).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Price Distribution by Fuel Type:</strong> Boxplots suggest Electric cars tend to have the highest median prices, followed by Hybrid, Petrol, and Diesel. 
                    However, all fuel types show wide price ranges, indicating variability within each group.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Brand-Wise Average Price:</strong> Brands like Chevrolet and Mercedes top the list in terms of average car prices, while others such as Honda and Hyundai are more affordable on average.
                </li>
            </ul>

                                    <strong>Build Predictive Models:</strong> Try regression models to predict car prices based on all features and evaluate model performance 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Time Series Forecasting:</strong> Use time-based models to predict future car prices or analyze how brands/fuel types evolve in popularity over time.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Interactive Dashboard:</strong> Turn our visualizations into an interactive dashboard, so users can filter by brand, fuel type, year, etc.

                                    <strong>Geospatial Insights:</strong> If location data is available, add mapping components to analyze price variation by region or city, which could uncover useful patterns in local markets.
